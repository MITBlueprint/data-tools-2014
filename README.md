Blueprint Data Tools
=====

This repo contains some nice Python scripts to help extract important info from registration data.

For now it contains a single script `HS_latlong.py`, used for extracting high school latitude and longitude locations from high school names in registration data on Wikipedia. It uses an exported CSV from Wufoo.
